/*
 * This file includes a teleop (driver-controlled) file for the goBILDA® StarterBot for the
 * 2025-2026 FIRST® Tech Challenge season DECODE™. It leverages a differential/Skid-Steer
 * system for robot mobility, one high-speed motor driving two "launcher wheels", and two servos
 * which feed that launcher.
 *
 * Likely the most niche concept we'll use in this example is closed-loop motor velocity control.
 * This control method reads the current speed as reported by the motor's encoder and applies a varying
 * amount of power to reach, and then hold a target velocity. The FTC SDK calls this control method
 * "RUN_USING_ENCODER". This contrasts to the default "RUN_WITHOUT_ENCODER" where you control the power
 * applied to the motor directly.
 * Since the dynamics of a launcher wheel system varies greatly from those of most other FTC mechanisms,
 * we will also need to adjust the "PIDF" coefficients with some that are a better fit for our application.

     * TECH TIP: State Machines
     * We use a "state machine" to control our launcher motor and feeder servos in this program.
     * The first step of a state machine is creating an enum that captures the different "states"
     * that our code can be in.
     * The core advantage of a state machine is that it allows us to continue to loop through all
     * of our code while only running specific code when it's necessary. We can continuously check
     * what "State" our machine is in, run the associated code, and when we are done with that step
     * move on to the next state.
     * This enum is called the "LaunchState". It reflects the current condition of the shooter
     * motor and we move through the enum when the user asks our code to fire a shot.
     * It starts at idle, when the user requests a launch, we enter SPIN_UP where we get the
     * motor up to speed, once it meets a minimum speed then it starts and then ends the launch process.
     * We can use higher level code to cycle through these states. But this allows us to write
     * functions and autonomous routines in a way that avoids loops within loops, and "waits".
